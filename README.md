# next-email

This project contains a React component along with its corresponding Next.js Route Handler for making an API call to the email service.

The service used in this project is [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/). For this to work, you must enable "Allow EmailJS API for non-browser applications." and "Use Private Key (recommended)" on Account > Security > API Settings. The private key will appear in Account > General > API Keys.

These should be placed in a .env.local file, along with the email service id and the email template id, as demonstrated in the [.env.local.demo](/.env.local.demo) file.

All of the component's utilities are in the `app/_components/ContactUs` folder and `app/api/route.ts` file. You need create this api route in your own project for the component to work, since it is called in the `sendEmail` function on the `ContactUs.tsx` component file.

This project uses the Axios library for sending messages to the EmailJS API, and Tailwind for styles.

# Running the demo locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
